          More than 35 years ago, I decided to use my extensive experience as a
          seamstress to start my own custom drapery business after realizing
          that most workrooms were limited by their inability to incorporate the
          dressmaker details and tailoring techniques required to create truly
          custom home furnishings. Since then, I've used my thorough
          understanding of fabric and design to fabricate high-end custom window
          treatments, bedding, pillows, cushions and slipcovers for interior
          designers in Chicago, Madison, Milwaukee and Traverse City.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>I complete each project according to precise measurements and
          meticulous sewing standards, ensuring your client's complete
          satisfaction. I am keenly aware of the significant investment your
          client has made, and I approach every project with professionalism and
          care. In addition, you may rely on my full assistance through all
          phases of a project from creative meetings to discuss style and design
          to accurate, on-site measurements. I then provide prompt, complete
          quotes including yardage requirements and lead times before
          fabricating all items to exact specifications. Additionally, I provide
          professional installation of even the largest and most complex
          projects. <br></br>
          <br></br>Custom Sewing & Design is also your complete resource for
          drapery rods, hardware, shades and shutters-saving you the hassle of
          complicated measurements, time-consuming vendor orders and tricky
          installations. I would very much appreciate the opportunity to meat
          with you personally to discuss your needs. I think you'll find that my
          fresh ideas and invaluable sewing experience would be an added value
          to both you and your clients.
